Parking Lot Design in Python for LLD Interviews.
We are building the following things:
1. A Parking Lot which can park vehicles - (car, two wheeler etc.)
2. There are many levels (floors) to the parking lot and each floor can park many vehicles
3. There is one entrance and one exit to the entire complex
4. Vehicles can park, unpark
5. We would also want to know which spot a vehicle is parked in (via its license plate) and conversely and which vehicle is parked in a spot
6. We would also like to find the closest (lowest level's) floor for the vehicle while parking - since vehicle enters from the ground floor (L0)
7. We would also want to "reserve" certain spots for parking and these spots will become free if not occupied before. 
8. We would also want to know how much parking ticket costs for a vehicle's parking duration - assume each spot has its own hourly rate.
